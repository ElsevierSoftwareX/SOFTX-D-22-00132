# GCpu_OpticalFlow
This code is an accelerated open-source software for 2D optical flow estimation and mechanical strain.   
The code is based on D. Sun method with some improvements. 
## Requirements
There are two versions of the software: a CPU and a GPU version.
You will need Python 3 (3.6 or higher) with the following modules:
