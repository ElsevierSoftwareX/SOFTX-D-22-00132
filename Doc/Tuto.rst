Tutorial
========


In this tutorial, you will quickly learn the basics of writing scripts using the code.

Before starting, you need to verify that all the :ref:`Requirements` for the desired version are already installed. 
First, it is mandatory to create a ``.py`` file. The main function that computes the displacement was implemented in ``compute_flow`` module and has the same name.

Therefore, you have to specify the path of  :ref:`Compute flow`. To do this, it's mandatory to use ``sys``:  

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    sys.path.append('Your/Path/Cucim/Src/')
    from compute_flow import *    

You can use ``imread`` function of  `OpenCV <https://opencv.org/>`_ to read the image sequence:

.. code-block:: python

    import cv2
    Im1 = cv2.imread('im1_path/Im1.extension', 0)
    Im2 = cv2.imread('im2_path/Im2.extension', 0)

.. note:: 

    ``imread`` can be used also to read the mask image.


``compute_flow`` function takes as input many **parameters** as described in :ref:`Compute flow`, it returns :math:`u`, :math:`v` the horizontal and vertical optical flow field respectively.
Before computing the displacements many variables must be adjusted.
 
.. code-block:: python

    u, v = compute_flow(Im1, Im2,pyram_levels, factor, ordre_inter,lmbda, 
            size_median_filter, max_linear_iter,max_iter, lambda2, lambda3,Mask, LO_filter)
